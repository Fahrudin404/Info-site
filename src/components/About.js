                Hello there! <br/> I am Software Engineer from Zenica and I am 22 Years old. I am interested in developing Web applications, such as this one with using React. React is really good for that. Fun fact: React has a brother, React Native. They share a similiar name, but work very differently. I even heard they don't like each other. But shhh You didn't hear that from me.
